- **How it works:**
- Calculates f(n) = g(n) + h(n) where g(n) is the cost so far and h(n) is the heuristic estimate to the goal. Uses a priority queue to always expand the lowest f(n) node.
- Applications: Robot motion planning, navigation systems, video game pathfinding.
- Complexity:
- Time: O(b^d) in worst case.
- Space: O(b^d)
