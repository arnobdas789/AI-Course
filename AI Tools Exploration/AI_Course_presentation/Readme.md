# 🤖 AI Theory & Game Implementation Project

## 📚 Course Overview

Throughout this course, I explored foundational concepts in **Artificial Intelligence theory**, focusing on **search algorithms**, **heuristics**, and **game-playing agents**.

Topics covered include:

### 🔍 Search Algorithms
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Depth-Limited Search
- Iterative Deepening DFS (IDDFS)
- Bidirectional Search
- A* Search
- Best-First Search
- Beam Search

### 🎮 Game Tree Algorithm
- Alpha-Beta Pruning

### 🧠 Knowledge-Based Search
- AO* Algorithm

### ⚙️ Heuristic & Optimization Techniques
- Hill Climbing
- Heuristic Search
- Maximum Finder

## 🕹️ Game Projects

I implemented AI logic for the following classic games:

- **Tic-Tac-Toe** – Minimax algorithm with optimal play.
- **Connect Four** – Search-based strategies with evaluation functions.
- **Chess** – AI opponent using Minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning (simplified version).

## 🎤 Presentation

To present my work effectively, I used **[Gamma](https://gamma.app/)** — an AI-powered visual storytelling tool that helped me create a professional 10-slide deck showcasing:

- AI algorithms and concepts covered
- Game implementations and logic behind each one
- Tools and languages used (e.g., Python, Pygame)
- Learnings and real-life applications of AI
